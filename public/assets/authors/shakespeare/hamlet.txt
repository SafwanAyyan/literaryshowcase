Here are the plot developments from The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, presented as a series of short, AP-style wire news stories for each major scene:

Elsinore, Denmark (I.1) – Royal Ghost Appears on Castle Battlements Sentinels Bernardo and Marcellus, joined by scholar Horatio, reported late last night the appearance of a ghostly figure on the Elsinore castle platform. The apparition, confirmed by Horatio, bore a striking resemblance to the late King Hamlet and was seen wearing the same armor he wore when he battled Norway's Fortinbras. Horatio described the sight as unsettling, suggesting it "bodes some strange eruption to our state". The ghost vanished at the sound of a cock crowing. The watchmen intend to inform young Hamlet of the occurrence.

Elsinore, Denmark (I.2) – King Claudius Addresses Court Amidst Unrest, Prince Hamlet Mourns King Claudius today publicly announced his marriage to Queen Gertrude, his brother's widow, at Elsinore Castle. He also addressed threats from young Fortinbras of Norway, dispatching envoys to Fortinbras's uncle to avert conflict. Laertes, son of Lord Polonius, received permission to return to France. Prince Hamlet, visibly distressed by his father's recent death and his mother's swift remarriage, was encouraged by the King and Queen to end his mourning and remain in Denmark, a request to which he reluctantly assented. Later, Hamlet's friends, Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo, revealed they saw a ghost resembling his father. Hamlet has agreed to join their watch tonight, demanding their absolute secrecy regarding the apparition.

Elsinore, Denmark (I.3) – Polonius Warns Ophelia Against Hamlet’s Affections Lord Polonius, before his son Laertes's departure for France, sternly advised Laertes on proper conduct abroad. Following Laertes's exit, Polonius interrogated his daughter, Ophelia, about her relationship with Prince Hamlet. Polonius dismissed Hamlet's expressions of affection as insincere and transient, firmly instructing Ophelia to cease all contact with the Prince, including refusing his letters and denying him access. Ophelia affirmed her obedience to her father's command.

Elsinore, Denmark (I.4) – Ghost Leads Hamlet Away from Watchmen As Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus stood watch on the castle platform tonight, a flourish of trumpets from within the castle signaled King Claudius's ongoing revelry, which Hamlet openly criticized as a custom that "Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations". The ghost of King Hamlet reappeared and beckoned Hamlet to follow it alone. Despite Horatio and Marcellus's desperate attempts to restrain him, fearing for his sanity and safety, Hamlet resolutely followed the apparition to a more secluded location. Marcellus was heard to remark, "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark".

Elsinore, Denmark (I.5) – King’s Ghost Reveals Murder by Claudius, Demands Revenge The ghost, identified as Hamlet's deceased father, revealed to Prince Hamlet that he was not killed by a serpent, as publicly believed, but was murdered by his brother, Claudius, who poured poison into his ear while he slept. The Ghost commanded Hamlet to avenge this "foul and most unnatural murther," but explicitly forbade him from harming his mother, Queen Gertrude, leaving her fate to heaven. The Ghost then vanished at dawn. A distraught Hamlet vowed to dedicate his life to this command and announced his intention to feign madness as a cover for his plans. He then compelled Horatio and Marcellus to swear secrecy regarding the night's events.

Elsinore, Denmark (II.1) – Hamlet’s Erratic Behavior Attributed to Love-Madness Lord Polonius today dispatched his servant Reynaldo to Paris to subtly investigate his son, Laertes's, conduct. Soon after, a terrified Ophelia reported to her father that Prince Hamlet appeared before her in a disheveled and distraught state, seemingly bereft of reason. Polonius, upon hearing Ophelia's account and recalling his instructions for her to reject Hamlet's advances, concluded that the Prince's erratic behavior stems from "the very ecstasy of love". He announced his intention to inform King Claudius of this diagnosis.

Elsinore, Denmark (II.2) – Royal Couple Summons Hamlet’s Friends; Players Arrive; Hamlet Plans a "Mousetrap" King Claudius and Queen Gertrude summoned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, childhood friends of Prince Hamlet, to Elsinore to determine the cause of Hamlet's recent "transformation" and distracting behavior. Polonius, after conveying news of a diplomatic resolution regarding Fortinbras's military movements towards Poland, asserted to the King and Queen that Hamlet's madness is solely due to unrequited love for Ophelia. Polonius proposed a plan for the King and himself to secretly observe an encounter between Hamlet and Ophelia. Hamlet, now interacting with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, quickly discerned they were sent by the King and Queen. He expressed a profound melancholy, declaring Denmark a "prison" and humanity a "quintessence of dust". The arrival of a company of players was announced. Hamlet engaged the First Player in a passionate recital, then, observing the player's emotional performance, resolved to use the players to stage a play, "The Mousetrap," mimicking his father's murder, in order to observe King Claudius's reaction and ascertain his guilt.

Elsinore, Denmark (III.1) – Hamlet Contemplates Existence, Rejects Ophelia King Claudius and Polonius, observing Hamlet's interaction with Ophelia, overheard the Prince deliver his famous soliloquy, "To be, or not to be," contemplating the merits of existence and suicide. When Ophelia attempted to return his "remembrances," Hamlet vehemently denied ever giving them and launched into a harsh, often cruel, tirade, urging her repeatedly to "Get thee to a nunnery". He accused women of deceit and artifice. Ophelia, distraught, lamented the apparent destruction of Hamlet's noble mind. King Claudius, convinced Hamlet's distress is not love-related but something dangerous, announced his decision to send Hamlet to England. Polonius, however, still suggested Queen Gertrude attempt to speak with Hamlet before his departure.

Elsinore, Denmark (III.2) – King Claudius Reacts to "The Mousetrap," Confirming Guilt Prince Hamlet today instructed the visiting players on the art of acting, emphasizing naturalness and restraint. Prior to the performance, Hamlet confided in Horatio, revealing his plan to stage a play, "The Mousetrap," to observe King Claudius's conscience. During the play's depiction of a king being poisoned in a garden, Hamlet provided provocative commentary. King Claudius rose abruptly, called for lights, and exited the performance in evident distress. Hamlet and Horatio concluded the King's reaction confirmed his guilt in his brother's murder. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern subsequently conveyed Queen Gertrude's summons for Hamlet to her chamber, while Polonius also relayed the message. Hamlet, acknowledging their manipulative attempts, resolved to speak harshly to his mother but refrain from physical harm.

Elsinore, Denmark (III.3) – Claudius Attempts Prayer, Hamlet Delays Revenge King Claudius, confirming Hamlet's impending voyage to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, stated his belief that Hamlet's "madness" poses a direct threat. Polonius announced his plan to hide in Queen Gertrude's closet to eavesdrop on her conversation with Hamlet. Alone, Claudius attempted to pray, openly confessing his "brother's murther!" and struggling with the impossibility of true repentance while still possessing the benefits of his crime: his crown, ambition, and queen. Meanwhile, Hamlet entered, discovered Claudius at prayer, but decided against killing him, reasoning that to do so while the King was in a state of prayer would send him to heaven, thus denying him true revenge. Hamlet resolved to wait for a more opportune moment, when Claudius was engaged in a sinful act.

Elsinore, Denmark (III.4) – Polonius Killed by Hamlet; Ghost Reappears to Hamlet In Queen Gertrude's private chamber, Polonius concealed himself behind an arras to overhear her conversation with Prince Hamlet. During a heated exchange where Hamlet harshly rebuked his mother for her hasty and "incestuous" marriage, Gertrude cried for help, prompting Polonius to echo her. Hamlet, believing the voice to be the King's, thrust his sword through the arras, fatally stabbing Polonius. The Ghost of King Hamlet then reappeared, visible only to Hamlet, to remind him of his "blunted purpose" and to urge him to show compassion to his mother. Gertrude, unable to see the Ghost, concluded Hamlet was mad. Hamlet, insisting on his sanity, implored his mother to confess her sins, repent, and abstain from sexual relations with King Claudius. Hamlet also informed her of his impending voyage to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, indicating his suspicion of their true mission. Hamlet then dragged Polonius's body from the room.

Elsinore, Denmark (IV.1) – Claudius Plans Swift Departure for Hamlet After Polonius’s Death Queen Gertrude today informed King Claudius that Prince Hamlet, in a fit of "lawless" madness, fatally stabbed Polonius while the counselor was hidden behind an arras in her closet. Claudius expressed profound alarm, recognizing the danger Hamlet poses to himself and the state. He immediately ordered Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to locate Hamlet and transport Polonius's body to the chapel. The King announced his swift decision to send Hamlet to England, indicating his intention to manage the perception of Polonius's death.

Elsinore, Denmark (IV.2) – Hamlet Taunts Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Evades Questions Prince Hamlet, having concealed Polonius's body, was confronted by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who demanded to know the body's whereabouts. Hamlet sarcastically referred to Rosencrantz as a "sponge" for soaking up the King's favors, implying he is a tool to be used and then discarded. He continued to speak in riddles, refusing to disclose Polonius's location and evaded their attempts to bring him to the King.

Elsinore, Denmark (IV.3) – Claudius Orders Hamlet’s Execution in England King Claudius, facing public pressure and unable to apply "strong law" against Hamlet due to popular support, confronted the Prince regarding Polonius's death. Hamlet responded with macabre humor about Polonius's body being consumed by worms, linking the fate of a "fat king" to a "lean beggar". He directed the King to seek Polonius in heaven, or in a month's time, by smell in the lobby. Claudius then formally ordered Hamlet's immediate departure for England, citing Hamlet's "especial safety". However, in an aside, Claudius revealed his true intent: he has sent sealed letters to England commanding Hamlet's "present death," viewing Hamlet as a dangerous "hectic in my blood" that must be eliminated.

Near Elsinore, Denmark (IV.4) – Fortinbras’s Resolve Spurs Hamlet to Action Prince Fortinbras of Norway and his army were observed marching across Denmark en route to Poland. Hamlet spoke with a Norwegian captain, learning that Fortinbras's forces are prepared to fight and risk their lives for a small, strategically insignificant "patch of ground" in Poland. This encounter deeply affected Hamlet, who, in a soliloquy, contrasted Fortinbras's decisive ambition for a trivial cause with his own delayed revenge for his father's murder and mother's "stain". Hamlet resolved that from this moment forward, his "thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!".

Elsinore, Denmark (IV.5) – Ophelia Descends into Madness, Laertes Returns Demanding Vengeance Ophelia, deeply affected by her father Polonius's death, has descended into madness, singing disjointed songs and distributing imaginary flowers with symbolic meanings. Queen Gertrude and Horatio observed her distressed state. King Claudius acknowledged that Ophelia's madness stems from her father's death and lamented the series of misfortunes befalling the royal family, stating "sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions!". Shortly after, a riotous Laertes, having secretly returned from France, stormed the castle with a mob, demanding answers for his father's death. Claudius, while calming Laertes, assured him of his innocence in Polonius's death and proposed an alliance to uncover the truth and ensure justice. Ophelia's re-entry in her deranged state further intensified Laertes's grief and resolve for vengeance.

Elsinore, Denmark (IV.6) – Hamlet Returns to Denmark, Reveals Pirate Encounter Sailors arrived at Elsinore today, delivering letters to Horatio and King Claudius. Horatio received a letter from Prince Hamlet, detailing a pirate attack at sea. Hamlet reported that his ship was overtaken, and in the ensuing grapple, he boarded the pirate vessel alone and was taken prisoner. He stated the pirates treated him "like thieves of mercy" and he is now back in Denmark, requesting Horatio join him immediately. The letter also confirmed that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are continuing their journey to England.

Elsinore, Denmark (IV.7) – Claudius and Laertes Plot Hamlet’s Death; Ophelia Drowns King Claudius convinced Laertes of his innocence in Polonius's death, attributing his inaction against Hamlet to the Queen's devotion and public opinion. News arrived via messenger that Prince Hamlet has returned to Denmark. Seizing this opportunity, Claudius and Laertes devised a new plot to kill Hamlet. They planned a fencing match where Laertes would use an unbated, poisoned sword. As a backup, Claudius would prepare a poisoned drink for Hamlet. Amidst their planning, Queen Gertrude delivered tragic news: Ophelia has drowned. Gertrude described Ophelia's death as accidental, occurring when she fell into a brook while hanging garlands, her waterlogged clothes pulling her down to a "muddy death". Laertes expressed profound grief but reinforced his commitment to revenge.

Elsinore, Denmark (V.1) – Gravediggers Debate Suicide; Hamlet Confronts Mortality, Ophelia’s Funeral In a churchyard, two gravediggers debated whether Ophelia, whose burial they prepared, should receive Christian burial, given the suspicious circumstances of her death. Prince Hamlet and Horatio arrived and observed the gravediggers, who humorously discussed the universal leveling of death, throwing up skulls. Hamlet held the skull of Yorick, the former court jester he knew as a child, reflecting on the grim reality of mortality and the eventual decay of all, from jesters to emperors. A funeral procession arrived, including King Claudius, Queen Gertrude, and Laertes. Hamlet realized it was Ophelia's funeral, marked by "maimed rites" due to the doubtful nature of her death. Laertes, overcome with grief, leaped into Ophelia's grave. Hamlet, revealing himself, then confronted Laertes, declaring his immense love for Ophelia and grappling with him in the grave. They were separated, and Hamlet departed.

Elsinore, Denmark (V.2) – Royal Family Decimated in Duel; Fortinbras Takes Danish Throne Prince Hamlet recounted to Horatio how he discovered and altered the King's order for his execution in England, redirecting it to command the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, for whom he felt no remorse. Hamlet expressed regret for his earlier aggression towards Laertes, seeing his own grief mirrored in Laertes's. Osric, a courtier, arrived to invite Hamlet to a fencing match with Laertes, orchestrated by King Claudius. Despite Horatio's reservations, Hamlet accepted, stating, "the readiness is all". Before the duel, Hamlet apologized to Laertes for his past actions, attributing them to madness. During the duel, Queen Gertrude, defying Claudius's warning, drank from a poisoned cup intended for Hamlet and died. Laertes wounded Hamlet with an envenomed rapier; in a scuffle, the rapiers were exchanged, and Hamlet wounded Laertes with the poisoned blade. A dying Laertes confessed the treachery and implicated King Claudius. Hamlet then fatally stabbed and forced the poisoned wine upon Claudius, who died. Laertes died, exchanging forgiveness with Hamlet. Hamlet, succumbing to the poison, designated Fortinbras as his successor and urged Horatio to tell his story truthfully. Fortinbras arrived with English Ambassadors, who reported the execution of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Horatio vowed to recount the entire "carnal, bloody and unnatural" chain of events. Fortinbras, embracing his new claim to the throne, ordered Hamlet to be honorably borne "like a soldier".
