Detailed Timeline of Main Events in Crime and Punishment
Pre-Novel Events (Background & Raskolnikov's State):

Raskolnikov's Poverty and Expulsion from University: Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former law student, lives in extreme poverty in St. Petersburg, heavily indebted to his landlady and with tattered clothing. This dire socio-economic condition leads to a nervous condition, monomania, and depression.
Development of Raskolnikov's "Superman" Theory: Influenced by Nietzschean and Napoleonic ideas, Raskolnikov develops a philosophy that "extraordinary" men are justified in transgressing moral laws and committing crimes for a higher purpose or the greater good. He sees the old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, as a "louse" whose death would benefit society.
Raskolnikov's Meeting with Marmeladov: In a tavern, Raskolnikov meets Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who reveals his family's destitution, including his daughter Sonya's forced prostitution to support them. Marmeladov's story highlights the pervasive poverty and suffering in St. Petersburg, which further fuels Raskolnikov's revolutionary thoughts.
Letter from Raskolnikov's Mother: Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother detailing his sister Dunya's difficult situation as a governess with her ill-intentioned employer, Svidrigailov, and her decision to marry the wealthy, conceited Luzhin to help her family and brother. Raskolnikov sees Dunya's sacrifice as akin to Sonya's, solidifying his resolve to act.
Raskolnikov's Preparatory Visit: Raskolnikov visits Alyona Ivanovna's apartment under the pretext of pawning a watch, but cannot bring himself to commit the crime.
Overhearing Lizaveta's Schedule: Raskolnikov conveniently learns that Lizaveta, Alyona Ivanovna's step-sister and servant, will be out of the house at 7 PM the following evening, leaving the pawnbroker alone. This coincidence solidifies his plan and he feels "condemned to death," pulled by fate.
Pre-Crime Dreams/Visions: Raskolnikov has a fearful dream of a mare being savagely beaten, which symbolically foreshadows his own violent act. He also dreams of an oasis, a subconscious yearning for a life opposed to his rationalist path.
Part 1: The Crime

The Murder of Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta Ivanovna: Raskolnikov, in a feverish and deliberating state, kills the elderly pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, with an axe. Unexpectedly, Lizaveta Ivanovna returns and Raskolnikov murders her as well to eliminate a witness, which deeply shakes him.
The Immediate Aftermath: Raskolnikov steals a small purse with some valuables, far less than anticipated, and quickly flees, hiding the stolen items under a large rock. He immediately falls into a state of fever, delirium, and profound guilt, feeling alienated from society.
Parts 2-6: The Punishment (Internal & External Turmoil)

Summons to the Police Station: The morning after the murders, Raskolnikov receives a summons to the police station regarding a debt to his landlady. While there, he overhears officers discussing the murders and faints, arousing suspicion from Zamyotov.
Extended Delirium and Recovery: Raskolnikov succumbs to his illness, experiencing prolonged delirium for several days. His friend Razumikhin finds and nurses him.
Confrontation with Luzhin: Dunya's fianc√©, Luzhin, arrives to introduce himself, but Raskolnikov deliberately insults and dismisses him.
Return to the Crime Scene & Encounter with Zamyotov: Driven by a subconscious urge to be caught, Raskolnikov visits the crime scene, asks suspicious questions, and openly mocks Zamyotov's suspicions, further confirming his guilt in the clerk's mind.
Marmeladov's Death: Raskolnikov witnesses Marmeladov struck mortally by a carriage and helps convey him home. Marmeladov dies in Sonya's arms, asking for her forgiveness. Raskolnikov gives his last 25 rubles to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral, feeling a momentary renewal of spirit.
Reunion with Mother and Sister: Raskolnikov returns to his room to find his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and sister, Dunya, waiting. He faints again.
Dunya Breaks Engagement with Luzhin: At a meeting arranged by Dunya, Luzhin exposes his true manipulative character, slandering Raskolnikov and Sonya. Dunya, now free due to Marfa Petrovna's will, breaks off the engagement.
Sonya's Visit: Sonya timidly visits Raskolnikov to invite him to her father's funeral. Raskolnikov asks for her address, planning to visit her.
Svidrigailov's Introduction: Svidrigailov, Dunya's former employer and abuser, appears at Raskolnikov's lodgings, revealing his presence in St. Petersburg and the unexpected death of his wife. He is depicted as Raskolnikov's "double" or dark reflection, embodying pure amorality and self-gratification without guilt.
Raskolnikov's First Confession to Sonya: After realizing how Luzhin tried to frame Sonya, Raskolnikov confesses his crime to Sonya, agonizingly trying to explain his abstract motives. Sonya, horrified but compassionate, urges him to confess to the police.
Svidrigailov Overhears Confession: Svidrigailov, residing next door to Sonya, overhears Raskolnikov's entire confession. He later reveals this knowledge to Raskolnikov, taunting him.
Katerina Ivanovna's Demise: Katerina Ivanovna, distraught and driven mad by poverty and illness, dies in Sonya's room after trying to force her children to perform in the street. Svidrigailov, unexpectedly generous, arranges her funeral and places the children in orphanages.
Raskolnikov's Confrontation with Porfiry Petrovich: The magistrate, Porfiry Petrovich, torments Raskolnikov with self-incriminating questions and ironic statements, hinting at his knowledge of Raskolnikov's article on "extraordinary men" and subtly pushing him towards confession. This is a psychological cat-and-mouse game.
False Confession: Another man bursts into the police station and falsely confesses to the murders, temporarily releasing Raskolnikov from immediate suspicion.
Svidrigailov's Final Attempts and Suicide: Svidrigailov makes a final, indecent assault on Dunya, but she rejects him with a gun. Crushed by her hatred, he gives Sonya money to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia and then commits suicide in a public place.
Raskolnikov's Decision to Confess: With Svidrigailov's death and Sonya's unwavering influence, Raskolnikov resolves to confess.
Final Conversation with Mother: Raskolnikov says a painful goodbye to his mother without revealing the truth of his crime.
Confession to the Police: Dunya waits for Raskolnikov. He stops at Sonya's, receives a crucifix, and despite learning of Svidrigailov's suicide at the police bureau (which almost makes him change his mind and leave), he sees Sonya's despairing gaze and returns to make a full and frank confession. He kisses the earth at Sonya's suggestion, a symbolic act of rejoining humanity.
Epilogue: Redemption and Regeneration

Sentence and Siberia: Raskolnikov is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude in Siberia due to the completeness of his confession and his mental state at the time of the murders.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna's Death: Raskolnikov's mother falls ill (mentally and physically) and dies, vaguely aware of her son's fate.
Sonya Follows to Siberia: Sonya follows Raskolnikov to the prison yard.
Raskolnikov's Struggle and Regeneration: Initially, Raskolnikov remains hostile and struggles to accept moral culpability, seeing himself only as weak. After some time in prison, under Sonya's loving influence and the symbolic imagery of nature, he begins his regeneration and spiritual rebirth, finally accepting Christian humility and suffering. He can finally sleep with a copy of the Bible, free from his old ideologies.
Cast of Characters
Principal Characters:

Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (Rodya/Rodia): The protagonist, a 23-year-old impoverished former law student in St. Petersburg. He is intelligent, handsome, yet cold, antisocial, and prone to monomania and depression.

She represents Christian humility, faith, and the power of love.
Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov: A sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer of Dunya, and a "double" or dark reflection of Raskolnikov. He embodies nihilism and amorality, committing acts of evil and even generosity without apparent guilt or purpose.
