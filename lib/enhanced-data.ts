She was mine in a glance, in a breath, in a **flame**,
But now only the *silence* remembers her name.`,

not quite lovers, not just friends—just two people standing at the edge of a *maybe*.
there were glances that lingered a second too long.
silences that said more than our words ever dared.
you held my gaze like it *meant something*.
i held my breath like it could *change everything*.

but we never stepped forward.
maybe out of fear.
maybe out of timing.
maybe because we both knew,
**almost** is safer than heartbreak.

still, sometimes i wonder what we could've been,
if "almost" had dared to become ***more***.`,

    content: `We were **almost**, but not quite
a spark lost in the endless night.
Not lovers, not quite friends,
just me hoping the story bends.

Your words were light, a gentle breeze,
but never meant to bring me ease.
You held my gaze, or so I'd thought—
while I caught feelings you *never* sought.

I stayed awake on silent screens,
chasing shadows, chasing dreams.
We never touched, not hand or heart,
yet still it tore me all apart.

Maybe you never saw me there,
maybe you simply didn't care.
**Almost** hurt me, but I stayed—
clinging to what you never gave.

Now I watch you drift away,
a ghost I loved, who couldn't stay.
And wonder still, as nights grow long,
what's left of me in your *silent song*?`,

    content: `the coffee didn't fix me,
but it stayed **warm**
long enough
for me to breathe again.

no deep thoughts this time,
just the hum of the machine
and the way *silence*
sometimes says more
than advice ever could.

i sat there,
half-sinking into my own weight,
watching steam curl like
a tired exhale —
gentle,
but still here.

i didn't cry.
didn't smile, either.
i just ***existed***,
and that was enough
for now.

some days,
healing doesn't look like a breakthrough.
it looks like not pouring the cup down the sink.
it looks like *showing up*,
even if you're quiet about it.

and the coffee?
still **warm**.
so maybe i'm not too far gone.`,

    content: `Beneath the weight of rolling years,
I stood two steps behind her fears.
A stranger caught in a glowing screen,
where shadows melted into night's sheen.

She came from places I'd not known,
a world beyond my sheltered zone.
Her words at first, a *distant song*,
yet slowly, they would pull me strong.

She held her truth, steady, kind,
her place was right, though worlds aligned
in different beats within one heart—
a quiet space where dreams might start.

At first unsure, my feelings grew,
a quiet hope that stayed true.
She met me kind, but kept her space—
a friendzone's gentle, **warm embrace**.

Too shy, too young, not quite her match,
a flame I longed for but couldn't catch.
Yet in her voice and memories kept,
a love asleep inside me slept.

Though *almost love* can bring its pain,
it leaves a melody to gain—
a fragile hope that time may show
what almost could become, and grow.

I wait where silence gently falls,
between the space of distant walls.
No rush to come, no need to say—
I'm here, if you should find your way.`,

    content: `they say some girls don't need to speak
to hold their ground, to stand unique.
it's in their presence, how they move
a quiet power, hard to prove.

he wasn't fully grown, still learning how to be alone.
life moved fast; he barely kept
the pace of feelings he had never met.

it started in an online space—
just classmates, games, a slower pace.
their school was boys alone, no mix,
so encountering her there—it didn't click.

she was older, a little loud, a little keen.
at first, he found her hard to read,
but maybe he just couldn't lead.

then slowly, something shifted pace.
she lingered—a voice, a glimpse, a face.
no big moment, no clear start,
just *silence creeping through the heart*.

they weren't close—just names online.
but still, she managed to live beneath his spine.
'a crush', he thought. it would decay.
but no—it stayed. it found its way.

then someone caught the way he fell.
the rumor spread. the silence shook.
within an hour, all had heard.
he smiled. he lied. he said no word.

in September, he let it show—
a message sent, a quiet "no."
she let him down with something kind.
it didn't break him—not at the time.

he fell too fast, confessed too soon,
mistook a spark to mean **full moon**.
with heart untrained, he leapt ahead—
and faced the quiet hurt instead.

but later, it began to sting,
a hollow kind of echoing.
she wasn't wrong; she owed him none
of what he hoped could be begun.

life unraveled bit by bit—
at home, at school, inside, he'd quit.
still, sometimes, she would message back.
no promise made, no deeper track.

he saved her words, her voice, her face—
not out of need, just in case
he'd want to feel what once had been
a moment that he had wandered in.

they never met. it stayed like that.
sometimes he wonders if that's flat—
a dream untouched that feels safe, unknown,
less fragile than what's fully grown.

"it's odd," he said with a distant stare,
still lost in a face he'd never met there.
a photo held what time made blur—
how did he fall in love with her?

he tried to date, he tried to heal.
but nothing really felt as real.
and somehow, he was back again—
her voice familiar as a friend.

this time, talks grew late and soft.
but still, the ground was never loft.
one wrong word, a shift, a pause—
and suddenly, the silence was because..

she blocked him from the space she hid,
but left one place where he still slid.
she asked if he still liked her. yes.
but, not like then. or maybe, ***even more***.

he cared for who they never were,
and maybe still, he cares for her.
she taught him things that he didn't know:
that love's not always built to grow,
that feelings young aren't always small,
and that silence doesn't mean no fall.

some people come and shape the way
you look at love, then walk away.
not villains, heroes, or "the one"—
just someone who, by chance, begun
a chapter you will always keep—
not loud or deep—
but quietly, when you're *half asleep*.`,
